# Project Title

ClearBite

## Overview

ClearBite helps users find specific ingredients in food products by searching barcodes or product names. It’s designed for seniors, kids, and individuals with food restrictions to easily check if a product is safe to eat.

### Problem Space

When I moved to Canada, I noticed that ingredient information on food packaging was written in very small letters. This is because companies are required by law to provide nutrition details in both English and French in Canada.
Checking ingredients on every product is challenging and time-consuming, especially for those with dietary restrictions or vision difficulties.

### User Profile

ClearBite is designed for individuals with vision difficulties, such as seniors and kids, as well as people with dietary restrictions, including those who follow halal, vegetarian, or vegan diets or have minor food allergies.

### Features

・Sign up and login function
・Searching function with option
・Function to see result showing if the ingredient is contained or not
・Saving function for the result
・List of saving

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

React, Node, Express, MySQL, Knex, BEM/SASS, npm, Postman,
Python(to organize data)

### APIs

The Google Images Search API or Walmart API

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually or write it out.

・Sign Up / Log In Page – Users can create an account and input their dietary preferences or restrictions for a more personalized search experience.
・Search Page – Users can search for products by typing the product name or entering a barcode to check ingredient details.
・Saved List Page – Users can save previously searched products for quick reference later

・Ingredient Checking Logic (Database or API to retrieve ingredient details)
・Saved List Implementation (Allow users to save past searches)

## Future Implementations

Expand to smartPhone using ReactNative or using PWA
(Progressive Web App) to make the app look like a mobile app.
Apply the Barcode reader function
